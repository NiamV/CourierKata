# Courier Kata - Niam Vaishnav

#### 1)

For this section, I have created a class `Package` that encapsulates a single package, and a class `CostCalculator` that will determine the cost of a list of packages stored in an array. The tests I need are:

- Test for no items
- Test for an individual item
- Test for multiple unique items
- Test for multiple duplicate items

The test results are as follows:

```bash
Run starting. Expected test count is: 7
CourierTest:
- Empty
- Single small
- Single medium
- Single large
- Single extra large
- One of each
- Two of each
Run completed in 214 milliseconds.
Total number of tests run: 7
Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
Tests: succeeded 7, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
All tests passed.
```
